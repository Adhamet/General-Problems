An degree is when a node is going to a node so  U -> V;

an in-degree is the V having an edge going into it from U, and so an out-degree is the U having an edge out to V;

Rules of what makes an Euler Graph if it's un-directed:
(1) Degrees are even;
(2) Connected;

Rules of what makes an Euler Graph if it's directed:
(1) For each node, it's in-degrees must be = out-degrees;

special case: if there's only one node, it's an Euler graph, but it won't happen.
